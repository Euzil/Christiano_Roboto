## Tutorial 7: ros2 run bullet_sims walking

Team Members: Theresa Gr√§bner, Youran Wang, Djamal Halim

### Note
We implemented static walking to show that we can make the robot walk. In dynamic walking the robot just fell over in our case and we would have needed more time to make it more stable such that it can walk stabily. Due to this, our plots are quite different from the ones shown on the pdf.
